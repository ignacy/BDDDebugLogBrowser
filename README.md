BluRayDebugLogBrowser
===

This is a simple app designed to help you browse log files generated by blu ray application.
I wrote this because tails -f piped into grep on my cygwin wasn't working as expected.

Usage
===

This project includes a compiled jar file (don't know if this is a good idea)
to run this you can use

    $> java -jar "dist/BDDDebugLogBrowser.jar"

Theres also a sh file in bin dir, you can use it like this:

    $> chmod +x bin/bddd
    $>./bin/bddd
